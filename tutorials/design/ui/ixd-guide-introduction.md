# Motivation

- Everyone knows interface design is important
- however, often neglected until it's too late
- or done without care (what works for me, works for others) --> missing accessibility
- or done without user input

- Design is easy and fun (with a bit of practice)
- It helps people and makes them have joyful experiences

# Goals of this guide

- Iterative development cycle
- Overview of analytic, design, prototyping and evaluation methods
- Contextualized for strategy games

- Guide is not telling you how to do make a specific design
- But: Present the tools for creating it
- Showing and analyzing useful RTS interface patterns in different contexts
- Good and bad examples from other games

# Openage engine considerations

- As an engine, many games with different audience and different goals
- No 'definitive' design possible
- End result is determined by the requirement of a mod/game running on the engine

- Focus on **sane defaults** and **develop solutions for common interface patterns**
- Incorporate new engine features into the old interface (more options, accessibility)
