# Introduction

![AoE2 resource bar]()

Resource bars in RTS games visualize the amount of resources a player has in stock. They are usually visible at all times and would not be considered optional. Players derive information from the resource bar to make strategic and tactical decision such as which unit they want to train or which technology they want to research.

Resource bars are assembled from individual resource label elements that each depict the amount of one specific resource. The basic form of these elements feature an icon that depicts the resource and a text label. Some games with only one resource do not assign an icon to the text label, as seen above for *C&C: Tiberian Sun*. However, it is still recommended to provide an icon for the only resource to make it stand out from the rest of the UI.

## Iconography

Because label elements are typically small, icons cannot be very detailed. Therefore, shape and color become much more important factors when designing resource icons. Be sure to choose a simple and recognizable representation for the resource, such as a dollar sign ($) for money. Examples for other mappings are

* **Food:** apples, pears, fruit baskets, processed meat, iconic food items (e.g. a burger)
* **Gold:** gold coins, gold bars
* **Metal:**  iron bars, steel bars

If possible, every icon should have a different shape *and* color than the other ones. You should not rely on color alone as this will create problems for players with color blindness.
